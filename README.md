TextRanker is a text indexing and search application designed to process a collection of text documents and rank them based on relevance to user queries. 
By utilizing the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm, TextRanker creates an index of terms and their frequencies across documents, allowing users to perform efficient and accurate searches. 
The project includes multiple functions such as reading text files, cleaning the data by removing stopwords and punctuation, and generating a global index. When a user submits a query, 
the system ranks the documents based on their relevance, offering a sorted list of results. This project serves as an effective tool for information retrieval and document analysis.
